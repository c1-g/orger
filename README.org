Orger converts things into org-mode, what else did you expect?


* TODO types of views
Static are meant to be read only and generated from scratch every time
Interactive are incremental. orger uses json file to keep track of items it already processed so you can modify existing entries.

** TODO using Interactive
   link to test for now?

* TODO better description, but might be easier to understand what it does just by looking at specific converters
